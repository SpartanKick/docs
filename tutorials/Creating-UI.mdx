title: "Creating UI with Coplay"
description: "Learn how to use Coplay to design complex UI windows, manage prefabs, and maintain visual consistency across your Unity project."

Building user interfaces in Unity often involves navigating deeply nested menus. **Coplay** simplifies this by allowing you to generate entire UI windows from natural language, automatically hook up logic, and ensure new elements match your existing project style.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:
    - Unity installed with the Coplay extension.
    - The **Active Scene** and **File Tree** context enabled in your Coplay settings.
    - A basic understanding of Unity's UGUI or UI Toolkit.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Your UI Structure">
    Instead of a vague request like "Make a menu," provide a structural prompt. This helps Coplay understand the hierarchy of the window you want to build.

    **Example Prompt:**
    ```text
    "Create a complex Settings window as a Canvas. Include a background panel and three child tabs for 'Audio', 'Graphics', and 'Controls'. Ensure all buttons use a Vertical Layout Group for organization."
    ```
    
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Style Matching & Consistency">
    To ensure your new UI doesn't look out of place, use Coplay to analyze your existing assets. 

    1. **Pin your source:** Use the `@` symbol to reference an existing UI Prefab.
    2. **Prompt for matching:** "Create a new 'Level Up' popup that matches the button styles, fonts, and color palette of **`@MainHUD_Prefab`**."

    <Tip>
      Advanced models like GPT-5 can analyze existing styles and replicate them perfectly across new prefabs.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save as Prefabs">
    AI-generated UI is most useful when it's reusable. Once you are happy with a layout, instruct Coplay to save it.

    **Prompt:**
    ```text
    "This looks perfect. Now, save this entire Settings window as a Prefab in the 'Assets/Prefabs/UI' folder."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Hook Up C# Logic">
    After the visual elements are in place, bridge the gap to your game code.

    * **Example:** "Reference the **`@UIManager.cs`** script and hook up the 'Back' button's `OnClick` event to the `CloseCurrentWindow()` method."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Managing 'Context Rot'">
    As your UI becomes more complex, the AI can experience "context rot" over long sessions. 

    **The Workflow Fix:** - Once a specific window is built and saved as a prefab, **Start a New Thread**. 
    - This clears out the old "designing" noise and gives the AI a fresh head-start for the next task, such as coding the data-binding or animations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Pro Tip:** For high-stakes UI work, use **StepByStep Mode**. It allows you to approve each layout group adjustment before the AI proceeds, preventing messy hierarchies.
