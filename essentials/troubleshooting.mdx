Nobody's perfect and neither is AI. In this guide, we'll discuss issues you may encounter while using Coplay. 

## Something went wrong
When using Coplay, you may get this error message in the chat window:
```
Something went wrong. Please try again later.
```
This is a generic error message that can occur for various reasons, such as network issues or server problems.
If you encounter this error, either clear the chat window by starting a new conversation and try again or, 
if you're  running a long-running task with the chat history as useful context, simply type "Continue where you left off".

Coplay will use the existing history to understand what needs to be done next and continue generating the response.

## Screenshot Loop
Coplay is a perfectionist and will keep working on a task until it is satisfied with the result. To check its work, Coplay will
occasionally take screenshots of the Scene or Game view to ensure that the changes are being applied correctly. 

This can sometimes lead to a situation where Coplay is stuck in a loop, taking screenshots of the same view over and over again, 
with only minimal changes in between. If you notice this happening, you can stop the task by clicking the "Stop" button in the chat window. 
This will interrupt Coplay's current task and allow you to start a new one.


## Compilation Errors
When writing code, Coplay may generate scripts in an unexpected order, which can cause compilation errors due to missing references.

Coplay will typically fix these errors automatically by continuing to generate code until the project compiles successfully. 

If Coplay has stopped running and you see compiliation errors, you can tell Coplay to fix them by starting a new conversation and typing:
```
Fix the compilation errors in my project
```
