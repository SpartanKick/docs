Coplay integrates seamlessly with Unity through an intuitive interface designed to enhance your game development workflow. This guide explains all the UI elements you'll encounter when using Coplay.

## Context

The Context dropdown determines what information Coplay has access to when responding to your queries:

- **File Tree**: Provides access to your project's file structure
- **Project Settings**: Gives context about your Unity project configuration
- **Active Scene**: Includes information about the currently open scene
- **Git History**: Provides access to version control information
- **Packages**: Shows information about installed packages

<Info>
  **Example usage**: Select "Active Scene" when asking Coplay to help optimize
  game objects in your current scene, or select "Project Settings" when
  troubleshooting configuration issues.
</Info>

## Mode

Coplay offers several modes that control how tasks are processed. Modes change often, so check the Discord release notes for up‑to‑date best practices. The available modes are:

- **Normal** (default) – Balanced performance that automatically executes a sequence of actions. Suitable for most tasks.
- **PipelineRecording** – Records every action in a session so you can replay the sequence or generate variations later. After recording, ask Coplay to "create a variation" to automatically apply changes based on the recorded pipeline.
- **Orchestrator** – Reads tasks from a `CoplayPlan.md` file and executes them in order. This autopilot mode aims to transform a design document into a working game. It is powerful but still experimental and may take longer to complete tasks.


When in doubt, start with **Normal** mode and adjust based on your use case.

## Model

Coplay lets you choose between the latest AI models from major foundational providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and X.AI. Each model offers distinct advantages for different Unity development tasks:

#### Anthropic

- **claude-3-7-sonnet**: (Default) Balanced model with exceptional reasoning capabilities; excellent for complex architectural decisions, debugging logic errors, and explaining game mechanics with detailed, well-structured responses. More thorough but slower, taking a step-by-step approach to problem solving.
- **claude-3-7-thinking**: Advanced reasoning model with enhanced step-by-step thinking capabilities, ideal for complex problem-solving tasks and detailed analysis of Unity systems. Excels at iterative thought processes.
- **claude-4-sonnet**: Newer general model with improved performance and understanding; offering superior code generation and architectural guidance for Unity projects. Excellent for coding tasks but slower in tool execution.
- **claude-4-thinking**: Advanced reasoning variant of Claude-4 with enhanced analytical capabilities, perfect for complex debugging and system design challenges that require thorough, methodical analysis.

### Inception

- **mercury-coder-small**: Experimental model that uses diffusion-based inference to generate code incrementally,
  resulting in significantly faster execution of sequential programming tasks.
- **mercury-coder-small-stream**: Streaming variant that leverages diffusion techniques to provide real-time
  response capabilities with enhanced speed benefits.

#### OpenAI

- **gpt-4.1**: Handles tasks in bulk and excels at UI development, image processing, and multiple tool execution. Can work quickly but may perform less well with complex coding tasks. Best for UI-focused work and batch operations.
- **o3**: Fast, cost-effective model for straightforward development tasks, good for quick syntax questions, simple script generation, and basic Unity workflow assistance during prototyping phases.
- **o4-mini**: Optimized for quick responses with good balance of speed and capability, effective for common Unity tasks like component setup, basic animations, and UI scripting with concise, practical answers.

### X.AI

- **grok-3**: Excels at creative problem-solving and unconventional solutions.

### Google

- **gemini-3-pro**: Strong multimodal capabilities that excels at analyzing visual elements, scene composition, and asset organization. Good with well-structured, multi-step requests and can handle actions in bulk. Offers a balanced approach between Claude Opus thoroughness and GPT-5.2's speed.
- **gemini-3-flash**: Optimized for speed and efficiency with good baseline understanding of Unity concepts, ideal for quick reference questions, syntax checking, and basic troubleshooting when immediate guidance is needed.

## Action Recording

Coplay can record your actions in the Unity Editor, allowing you to:

1. Track movements and changes to game objects
2. Delete specific recorded actions using the "×" button
3. Clear all recorded actions at once
4. Save recordings for future reference

When you've finished recording actions, you can save them with a custom name and use them for additional context in future tasks.

<Info>
  **Example usage**: Record a sequence of object placements to document your
  level design process, then ask Coplay to analyze the pattern or suggest
  improvements.

## Memory (configurability coming soon...)

Long-term memory is currently stored server side, we will soon release support for listing and continuing prior conversations
