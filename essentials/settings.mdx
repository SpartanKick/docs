### Anthropic API Key
To use Coplay with Anthropic's AI models, you need to provide your API key. 
This key is essential for authenticating your requests to the Anthropic API.

### Key settings

- **Coplay User**: Your account email address
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for your installation device
- **Highlight Changes**: When enabled, Coplay will highlight changes it makes to your projects
- **Enable Autocomplete**: Activates AI-powered code completion as you type
- **Max Requests**: The number of requests Coplay will make automonously before prompting you for confirmation

### Custom Coplay Rules

You can also manage custom rules through the "Edit Custom Coplay Rules" button,
which opens a dialog enabling you to create specialized instructions for Coplay
that will be saved to `.coplayrules.md` in your project root folder. 
This will cause Coplay to include this as additional context before it takes any action

<Info>
  **Example usage**: Create custom rules like "Always comment public methods" or "Follow our team's naming convention" to ensure Coplay adheres to your project standards. 
</Info>

<Info>
  You can also reference other files if you have pre-existing instructions / best practices: "Before any task is started, read handovernotes.md to understand the dependencies and context of the project you are working on."
</Info>

### MCP Servers
Coplay supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for advanced AI interactions.
You can configure multiple MCP servers to extend Coplay's capabilities, such as integrating with Blender for 3D asset generation.
Click the "Edit MCP Servers" button in the settings panel to manage your MCP server configurations.

<Info>
For an example of how to set up a Blender MCP server, see our [Blender MCP tutorial](/tutorials/blender-mcp).

```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "blender-mcp": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": [
          "blender-mcp"
        ],
        "env": {
          "PATH": "/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
        }
      }
    }
  }
    ```


### External Documentation and Web Search

If Coplay is unfamiliar with a framework or API you’re using, you can provide it with the necessary documentation and instruct it to consult those resources when performing tasks. There are two ways to do this:

- **Download and include docs in your project**: Save the official documentation (e.g., for Meta SDK or Unity 6.2 input) into a folder under your project (for example `Docs/third-party/meta-sdk`). Then reference these files in your `.coplayrules.md` file so the model will read them before executing tasks. After editing `.coplayrules.md`, start a new chat thread to ensure the changes are loaded.

- **Use the built‑in web search**: Coplay version 4.3.0 and later can search the web to find documentation when needed. In your prompts you can instruct Coplay to search a resource (e.g., "search meta XR docs") and it will retrieve the relevant docs on the fly. This feature complements local docs and can be particularly helpful when you don’t have the documentation downloaded.

Notes: Coplay already has access to Unity documentation for the version you’re using, so you generally don’t need to provide it manually, but you can ask it to consult Unity docs explicitly if you wish. When using new features like web search or external docs, refer to the release notes in Discord for the latest guidance.
