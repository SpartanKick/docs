Coplay supports **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**. The data below represents our latest internal metrics for the average cost of a single interaction (prompt + response).

<Callout type="info">
  **Pricing Definition:** These figures are not "per 1k tokens." They represent the **average cost per prompt** in Coplay, measured across millions of user requests to provide the most accurate "real-world" budget estimate.

## 🏷️ Live Price List (Coplay User Averages)

### 🟢 OpenAI Models
OpenAI's GPT-5 series remains the leader for professional task reliability and tool-calling precision.

| Model | Avg. Cost / Prompt | Total User Requests | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GPT-5.2** | **$0.032** | 583 | **The Expert.** High-stakes professional logic. |
| **GPT-5.1** | **$0.031** | 22,289 | **The Workhorse.** High-throughput reasoning. |
| **GPT-5.1 Codex** | **$0.030** | 2,595 | **Logic King.** Best for complex C# architecture. |
| **GPT-5.1 Codex Max** | **$0.023** | 823 | **Deep Context.** Large file processing/scanning. |
| **GPT-4.1** | **$0.035** | 1,438 | **Legacy Logic.** Stable but higher avg. cost/prompt. |

### 🟣 Anthropic (Claude)
The Claude 4.5 family dominates the coding leaderboard, particularly for "agentic" workflows.

| Model | Avg. Cost / Prompt | Total User Requests | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claude 4.5 Opus** | **$0.110** | 30,980 | **The Architect.** Unrivaled multi-file refactors. |
| **Claude 4.5 Sonnet**| **$0.100** | 28,030 | **The Gold Standard.** Favorite for Unity devs. |
| **Claude 4.5 Haiku** | **$0.025** | 10,282 | **Speed Specialist.** Fast edits and sub-tasks. |
| **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**| **$0.026** | 181 | **Value Reasoning.** Efficient middle-ground. |
| **Claude 4.1 Opus** | **$0.088** | 11 | **Legacy.** Maintained for specific edge cases. |

### 🔵 Google & Others (Specialized)
Gemini 3 Pro remains a massive outlier for high-volume context users.

| Model | Avg. Cost / Prompt | Total User Requests | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini 3 Pro** | **$0.140** | 171,602 | **Context Beast.** Massive codebase ingestion. |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | **$0.062** | 10,651 | **Large Memory.** Reliable wide-context tasks. |
| **Nova Premier VL** | **$0.083** | 2 | **Multimodal.** Advanced video/image logic. |
| **Jamba Large 1.7** | **$0.065** | 2 | **Speed.** Ultra-low latency for long output. |

## 💰 Critical Billing Rules

<Callout type="warning">
  **The 5-Minute Cache Window:** Anthropic and Google prices drop by ~90% when context is cached. However, if you wait more than **5 minutes** between replies, the cache expires, and you are billed the full price for your entire history again.
</Callout>

### 📉 Efficiency Strategies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prune Your Pins">
    **Unpin files** (`@`) as soon as you are done with them. Every pinned file adds to the input cost of *every* subsequent message.
  </Step>

  <Step title="The 200k Token Reset">
    Once a thread exceeds **200,000 tokens**, providers often double the per-token rate. When you hit this "Double Cost" threshold, **Start a New Thread**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Smart Routing">
    Use **Gemini 3 Pro** for deep codebase research, but switch to **Claude 4.5 Haiku** or **GPT-5.1** for writing individual methods to keep your average cost per prompt low.
  </Step>
