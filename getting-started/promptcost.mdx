Coplay supports **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**. The data below represents the average cost of a single interaction (prompt + response) based on real-world usage metrics.

<Callout type="info">
  **Pricing Definition:** These figures represent the **average cost per prompt** in Coplay, measured across our user base. This is a more accurate "real-world" estimate than simple per-token rates.

## 💰 Critical Billing Rules

<Callout type="warning">
  **The 5-Minute Cache Window:** Anthropic and Google prices drop significantly when context is cached. However, if you wait more than **5 minutes** between replies, the cache expires, and you are billed the full price for your history again.
</Callout>

### 📉 Efficiency Strategies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prune Your Pins">
    **Unpin files** (`@`) as soon as you are done with them. Every pinned file adds to the input cost of *every* message in that thread.
  </Step>

  <Step title="The 200k Token Reset">
    Once a thread exceeds **200,000 tokens**, providers often implement a surcharge. When you hit this threshold, **Start a New Thread**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Smart Routing">
    Use **Gemini 3 Pro** for deep codebase research, but switch to **Claude 4.5 Haiku** or **GPT-5.1** for writing individual methods to keep your costs low.
  </Step>
