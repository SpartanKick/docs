Coplay supports "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) for the latest AI models. However, advanced billing mechanics like **Context Caching** and **Token Thresholds** can drastically affect your bill. Use this guide to optimize your spending.

## 💰 The "Hidden" Costs

Beyond the standard price per token, there are three critical rules that affect your final bill:

### 1. The 5-Minute Cache Rule
Most providers (like Anthropic and Google) offer "Context Caching" to make long chats cheaper.
* **The Trap:** Cache typically resets after **5 minutes of inactivity**.
* **The Cost:** If you wait 6 minutes to reply, the cache clears, and you are charged the **full non-cached rate** (often **10x higher**) to re-process your entire history.
* **Fix:** For long, complex sessions, try to keep your replies frequent to keep the cache alive.

### 2. The 200k Token Threshold
* **The Rule:** Once your active context (pinned files + chat history) exceeds **200,000 tokens**, many providers **double the cost per token** for the excess.
* **Fix:** If you hit this limit, immediately **Start a New Thread** to reset your token count.

### 3. The Multiplier Effect
You pay for **Input Tokens** on every single message. If you pin a 10,000-token script and ask 5 questions about it, you pay for those 10,000 tokens **5 times**.

### 🟢 OpenAI Models
The industry standard for logic and coding capability.

| Model | Price | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GPT-5.2** | **$0.042** | **The Flagship.** The most powerful and expensive model available. Use for critical architecture planning. |
| **GPT-5.1** | **$0.032** | **Balanced High-End.** Excellent general reasoning at a better rate than 5.2. |
| **GPT-5.1 Codex** | **$0.032** | **Code Specialist.** Optimized specifically for programming tasks. Best for generation C# scripts. |
| **GPT-5.1 Codex Max**| **$0.032** | **Large Context.** Same pricing as Codex but likely supports larger context windows for huge files. |
| **GPT-4.1** | **$0.014** | **Budget Logic.** A solid, reliable option for standard tasks where "cutting edge" intelligence isn't required. |

### 🟣 Anthropic (Claude)
Known for high-quality prose and excellent code explanations.

| Model | Price | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Claude 4.5 Opus** | **$0.055** | **Deepest Reasoning.** Extremely expensive. Use only for the most complex, nuanced problems. |
| **Claude 4.5 Sonnet**| **$0.038** | **The Gold Standard.** Balanced speed and smarts. The community favorite for Unity C#. |
| **Claude 4.5 Haiku** | **$0.026** | **Fast & Efficient.** Great for quick chats or simple refactors. |

### 🔵 Google (Gemini)
Unique speed and massive context handling.

| Model | Price | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini 3 Pro** | **FREE\*** | **Best Value.** Currently **Free for Subscribed Users** until the end of 2025. Use this for everything! |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | **$0.031** | **Legacy High-End.** Good performance, but generally outperformed by v3. |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | **$0.005** | **Ultra Cheap.** The absolute cheapest paid option. Perfect for massive, repetitive tasks. |

*\*Free access to Gemini 3 Pro is a limited-time offer for subscribers ending Dec 31, 2025.*

## 📉 Optimization Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Abuse the Free Tier">
    Since **Gemini 3 Pro** is free for subscribers right now, use it for 100% of your heavy lifting (refactoring, documentation, experimentation) to save your paid credits for critical polish.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch the Clock">
    If you are in a "deep dive" session with a huge context, **don't take a 10-minute coffee break**. The cache will expire, and your next prompt will cost 10x more. Finish the session or close the thread first.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prune Context Aggressively">
    Once you finish working on a file, **Unpin it (`@`)**. Carrying dead weight in your context is the fastest way to hit the 200k "Double Cost" threshold.
  </Step>
