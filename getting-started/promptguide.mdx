Effective communication is key to efficiency. By organizing your requests using a clear framework, you eliminate guesswork for **Coplay** and ensure the output—be it code, refactoring, or scene analysis—is always ready to use in your Unity project.

## 🧱 The Optimal Prompt Formula

Every high-quality **Coplay** prompt should contain these three components:

### **1. Initial State (The Context)**

Define where you are starting. Include the necessary background, the existing issue, or the component you plan to modify.

- **Example:** "I have a third-person camera system using Cinemachine. The shake on impact is jarring."
- 

### **2. Desired Outcome (The Goal)**

State exactly what you want the AI to deliver. Be specific about the functionality and the performance criteria.

- **Example:** "Refactor the camera script to smoothly ramp up and then immediately decay the shake effect over 0.75 seconds to feel more natural."

### **3. Response Specifications (The Format)**

Tell **Coplay** where the change should happen and how the output should be structured.

- **Example:** "Provide the full C# script for **`@CameraControl.cs`** with the new logic, ensuring all public fields are serialized."

<Tip>
  A great prompt is always focused: **What is happening?** ➡️ **What should happen?** ➡️ **Where should it go?**
</Tip>

## 🧭 Ensuring Project Focus

**Coplay** is project-aware, but you must direct its attention. Always reference specific files or objects to ensure the AI uses the correct context from your Unity project.

### **Always Reference Assets**

Avoid generalized language. Use file pinning (like the `@` symbol) or the in-editor selection tools to ensure **Coplay** is working on the correct scripts, prefabs, or scenes.

- **Effective:** "Please update the `PlayerAttack()` function inside **`@MeleeCombatSystem.cs`** to..."
- **Ineffective:** "Fix the player's attack script..."

### **Use the Action Recorder**

If your workflow involves complex, sequential tasks in the Unity editor (like configuring an Animator component or adjusting particle effects), use the **Action Recorder** to show **Coplay** the exact steps you typically perform. The AI can then use this recorded workflow as part of its context.

<Warning>
  Asking **Coplay** to perform tasks like "Fix all compilation errors" will yield poor results. Be precise: "Address the specific type error in the **`@HealthBarUI.cs`** script."
</Warning>

## ♻️ Dealing with Subpar Outputs

If **Coplay** generates an incorrect or incomplete response, resist the urge to debug it conversationally.

### **Prioritize the Edit Function**

If the result is close, use the **Edit** button on your original prompt to add a specific correction or clarification, then regenerate the response.

- **Do this:** "The code is great, but change the **`gameObject.Find()`** call to use **`GetComponentInChildren()`** instead."

### **Know When to Reset**

If the AI misunderstands the core objective after the first attempt, it's more efficient to **Start a New Thread**. A clean start ensures the model is not polluted by the failed attempts and has a fresh contextual memory for your request.
