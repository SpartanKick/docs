## Getting Started with Coplay

Once you have Coplay installed and authenticated, you're ready to start using it to enhance your Unity development workflow.

**Step 1**: Open Coplay in Unity:

<CodeGroup>

```text Mac
Command + G
```


```text Windows
Control + G
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2:** Choose your Coplay settings, including your Mode, Model, and Context availability. For more information on available settings, visit the [Settings](/essentials/settings) page.

**Step 3**: Start interacting with Coplay by typing in your questions or commands in the chat panel.

```csharp
// Ask Coplay about Unity concepts like:
"How do I implement a character controller in Unity?"
```

```csharp
// Or get specific code help:
"Write a script to make my camera follow the player with smooth damping"
```

```csharp
// Debug existing code:
"Why is my collision detection not working properly?"
```

By default, Coplay will only provide suggestions and instructions of how to implement these changes in Unity. For Coplay to act on your befalf, check "Auto-Approve" and Coplay will proceed uninterrupted as it generates actions in your project.

### Tips for Effective Usage

1. **Context-Aware Queries**: Always select the appropriate context for your question to get the most relevant answers
2. **Mode Switching**: Change agent modes based on your current development focus
3. **Model Selection**: Use faster models for simple tasks and more advanced models for complex problems
4. **Action Recording**: Use action recording to document processes that you want to analyze or replicate later
5. **Custom Rules**: Set up custom rules to ensure Coplay aligns with your team's development standards

For more detailed information on configuring Coplay's behavior, see the [Configuration Guide](/essentials/configuration).
