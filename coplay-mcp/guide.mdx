<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Ensure you have Coplay properly installed in your Unity project before proceeding.

  If you haven't installed Coplay yet, please follow our [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation) first.

  You'll need Python 3.11 or higher, and `uv` installed.

## What is Coplay MCP

Coplay MCP is an interface that lets you control Coplay inside Unity from your favorite MCP client such as Cline or Claude Code.

As an example, here's a video in which [we use Coplay's MCP to edit multiple Unity projects simultaneously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lphJPLfkXN8).

## Setting up Coplay MCP

Once you have Coplay installed and authenticated, you're ready to connect the Coplay MCP.

### Claude Code

Run this command:

`claude mcp add --scope user --transport stdio coplay-mcp --env MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT=720000 -- uvx --python ">=3.11" coplay-mcp-server@latest`

### Cursor & Cline

Add this config to your MCP host:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "coplay-mcp": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 720,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--python",
        ">=3.11",
        "coplay-mcp-server@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

1. Use CMD/Ctrl + Shift + P to open the Command Palette
2. Choose **MCP: Add Server**
3. Choose **stdio**
4. Enter this command: `uvx --python >=3.11 coplay-mcp-server@latest`
5. Enter `coplay-mcp` as the identifier

### Antigravity

1. Open the MCP Servers menu in the top right.
2. Select Manage MCP Servers.
3. Click View Role Config to open your mcp_config.json file.
4. Add the following configuration to your MCP list:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "coplay-mcp": {
            "disabled": false,
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "--python",
                ">=3.11",
                "coplay-mcp-server@latest"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

5. Save the file and click Refresh in the MCP Manager to see Coplay appear in the list.

### Testing

To test that your Coplay MCP works, prompt your MCP client (e.g., Cursor or ChatGPT) with something like: `List all of the open unity editors using Coplay MCP`. If this yields the actual list of open editors, you're good to go.

### Note

We set the timeout to 720s (12 minutes) because using the coplay_task tool can run for quite a while in Unity depending on the task. If you don't plan to use the coplay_task tool, you can set the timeout to a more reasonable value such as 60s.

## Example config for Codex CLI

For Codex CLI you need to edit your `~/.codex/config.toml` file to include the Coplay MCP server:

```
[mcp_servers.coplay_mcp]
command = "uvx"
args = ["--python", ">=3.11", "coplay-mcp-server@latest"]
env = { "MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT" = "720000" }
```
